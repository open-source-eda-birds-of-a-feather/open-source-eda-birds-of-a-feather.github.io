This "Open-Source EDA, Data and Collaboration" Birds-of-a-Feather session is the sixth in a series that began with the DAC [2018](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m8ZJEvfLcUhiL1KX7rj18gzi-zLhI6P2), [2019](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/Birds-of-a-Feather-Open-Source-Academic-EDA-Software/wiki/DAC-2019-Birds-of-a-Feather:-Open-Source-Academic-EDA-Software), [2022](./README_2022.md), [2023](./README_2023.md) and [2024](./README_2024.md) Open-Source Academic EDA Software Birds-of-a-Feather sessions. These sessions include a number of participants who also attend the [WOSET](https://woset-workshop.github.io/) and [OSDA](https://osda.ws/) workshops. This session at [DAC 2025](https://www.dac.com/) serves as an informal meeting point for anyone who would like to hear or share ideas or latest updates on the following topics:
1. The global ecosystem and landscape of open-source EDA tools and industrial usage
2. The use of open-source EDA tools for Education and Workforce Development
3. Applications and Data for AI/ML-boosted EDA and design
4. Benchmarks, benchmarking and research practices as enabled by open source
5. Community goals, principles and practices for the worldwide open-source EDA community.
  
Potential contributors, developers, advisors, users … **Everyone is Welcome and Admission is Free for All !!!** (Please send email to [abk@ucsd.edu](mailto:abk@ucsd.edu) with any questions.)
